## Rule

- Players alternate turns placing a piece on an empty intersection.
- Try to build a row/circle/triangle of six pieces
- When a row/circle/triangle is finished, player can get the sum of points on the six pieces
- 2 pieces with 6 points, 3 pieces with 5, 3 pieces with 4, 5 pieces with 3, 5 pieces with 2, 6 pieces with 1
- All pieces are used / No more place for pieces, game is over
